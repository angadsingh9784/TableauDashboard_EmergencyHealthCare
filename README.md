# TableauDashboard_EmergencyHealthCare
This project analyzes the relationship between wait time and patient satisfaction in emergency care using data visualization techniques in Tableau. The goal is to understand whether reducing wait times directly improves patient experience or if other factors play a larger role.

📌 Project Title: Emergency Care Analytics: Wait Time vs. Patient Satisfaction

🔍 Project Overview:
This project analyzes the relationship between wait time and patient satisfaction in emergency care using data visualization techniques in Tableau. The goal is to understand whether reducing wait times directly improves patient experience or if other factors play a larger role.

💡 Key Insights from the Dashboard:
✅ No strong correlation (-0.3648) between wait time & satisfaction, suggesting factors like communication and care quality may influence satisfaction more.
✅ Readmission rates are highest among older patients (71-100 age group), highlighting the need for better post-discharge care.
✅ Telehealth utilization varies seasonally, with peaks during flu seasons, indicating its potential to reduce ER overload.
